
# Overview

Bagatur chess engine is one of the strongest Java chess engines in the world.
It is also available for Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bagaturchess">Bagatur Chess Engine with GUI</a> game, which has its own user interface. If you like the project, please give it a star.

# Downloads

The <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur-Chess-Engine-And-Tools/tree/master/Downloads/Engine">latest release</a> runs under all Operating Systems, which support Java platform.

# Sources

The <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur-Chess-Engine-And-Tools/tree/master/Sources">source code</a> is writen entirely in Java programming language.

# ELO Rating

The <a href="http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?family=Bagatur">ELO rating</a> is an important metric for a chess engine.

# Machine Learning

There are some code examples of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning experiments with the <a href="http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/">Neuroph</a> 2.94 Java framework.
The starting point into the source code is located <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl/src/bagaturchess/deeplearning/run">here</a> and the documentation is <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl">here</a>.
Although the ELO strength of the experimential version is with 50 ELO less than the version with the manually tuned evaluation function's parameters, the results are successful meaning that the neural network's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a> algorithm works as expected for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">multi layer perceptron</a> neural network. This makes the experiments a good showcase of <a href="http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/">Neuroph</a> Java framework.

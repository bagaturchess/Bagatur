 * LMR skips are more often on moves which produce beta cutoffs
 
 Version 5.1 (17 June 2024)
 * NNUE in Java based on Bullet trainer and custom training process. More info: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/NNUE
 
 Version 5.0 (2 June 2024)
 * NNUE Java porting implemented and works correctly without incremental updates. More info: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/NNUE
 * Switching the default evaluation to NNUE Java as it is now 100 Elo stronger than the classical version. (Which was NOT the case with JNI NNUE version introduced in version 4.1a)
 
 Version 4.1a (30 January 2024)
 * NNUE support - adding script files for running under Linux for both 1 core and multicore versions
 * NNUE support - adding exe and bat files for multicore version under Windows
 
 Version 4.1 (23 January 2024)

 Version 3.7e (26 December 2023)
 * Bugfixing - mate with bishop and knight is now possible.
 * EGTB Handling: return score directly if there is EGTB hit.
 * EGTB Handling: search scores of Draw and EGTB hits are now stored in TT again.
 
 Version 3.7d (24 May 2023)
 * 3.7c is still weaker than version 3.0. These changes in 3.7d aim to restore the ELO strength.
 * Move ordering: bad captures are now before quiet moves (like in version 3.0).
 * Search: Randomize move lists before sorting 2.5 times more often.
 * Search: Switch on Adaptive LMR, it keeps around 5% of all nodes not reduced by LMR.
 * EGTB Handling: search scores of Draw, Mate and EGTB hits are not stored in TT.

 Version 3.7c (1 May 2023)
 * 3.7b is still weaker than version 3.0. These changes aim to restore the ELO after the new features and changes after 3.0:
 * Keep Continuation History tables between the searches and not clear them, like in version 3.0.
 * Enable again the LMR reduction's skip rate with a high value in order to not affect CPU performance.
 
Version 3.7b (25 March 2023)

Version 3.7a (18 February 2023)
 * Change the condition for randomizing the non-attacking moves. Now they are always randomized.
 
Version 3.7 (07 February 2023)
 * SMP version:
 * 1. On https://tcec-chess.com/ S24, there is still NPS scaling issue, because the achieved value is 5-10M nps and the expected is 30M nps.
 * 2. The issue is reproducible on CentOS Stream release 8 and Java OpenJDK 1.8.0.
 * 3. The tests show that with up to 64 cores (128 logical processors) it still achieves more stable and deeper depth, for a fixed time, with only 1 Transposition Table, although the NPS is between 3 and 6 times smaller.
 * 4. A new UCI option is introduced for SMP version - CountTranspositionTables.
 * 5. On CentOS Stream release 8 and Java OpenJDK 1.8.0, with 8 Transposition Tables the SMP search achieves similar depth and time, so there is sense to set it not to be 1, only when there is a NPS scaling issue. In such cases it could be set up to SQRT(THREADS_COUNT) Transposition Tables.
 * 6. More details about the tests of the SMP version, could be found here: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/Search#readme
 * 7. Bug fixing and optimizations inside the bagaturchess.search.impl.rootsearch.parallel.SearchersInfo class.
 * 8. SMP version: Code clean up and simplification
 * 
 * Single Core version
 * 1. Randomize the non-attacking moves, before moves' ordering and sorting, in order to benefit from the search's undeterminism and minimize error.
 

Version 3.6b (04 September 2022)
  * TBs: DTZ or DTM check improved. Still not 100% accurate - alone king condition used. Still direct DTM from native syzygy lib is not used, because of JNI/C types related issues, which need more time.
  * TBs: Syzygy native lib changes and JNI integration code adoption - methods time are incorrect. How Value has to be converted to int?
  * Search revision: move ordering based on the LMR beta cutoff move's ration. Added clear method in History Tables. CLEAR_TABLES_ON_NEW_SEARCH flag introduced and set to false.
  * Search revision: enable LMP and LMR for all nodes (without statistical constraints - in this case "faster" is over "too accurate")
  
Version 3.6a (21 August 2022)
  * Bugfixing: Syzygy TB support - DTZ handling

Version 3.4g (29 July 2022)
  * Bugfixing (not related with FRC), of an issue introduced with version 3.4f. It is related with the extraction of moves from Transposition Table and building the PV to show as output.
  * Bugfixing (not related with FRC), sometimes in mate positions, after repetition of move 2 times, Bagatur evaluation jumps between 0 and +-mate score.
  
Version 3.4f (24 July 2022)
  * Fix for FRC: send castling moves to GUI always as "king capture own rook"
  
Version 3.4e (14 July 2022)
  * Fixes for FRC: prevent king being attacked after castling (e.g. 1rn2r2/1pnkb3/2ppp3/p4p2/2P2P2/1P1BN3/3PPBP1/q1KR3R w - - 0 22)
  * Add one more way for FRC castling notation in addition to "capture own rook or equal from_to square" - when king move has file difference bigger then 1, like in classic chess
  
Version 3.4d (13 July 2022)

  * Disabled TB support for single core version, because it has issues (for SMP version it is already disabled)
    
Version 3.3 (30 May 2022)
  * Introducing new UCI options for better memory and scalability management, especially in SMP version:
  * MemoryUsagePercent, TranspositionTable, IsGlobalTranspositionTable, EvalCache
  * SMP version scales on 104 logical cores during TCEC Season 22 testing games and achieved 22 Mnps with IsGlobalTranspositionTable UCI option set to false

Version 3.2 (19 January 2022)
  * Hotfix: TBs are temporarily switched off in SMP version, because of crashes in libJSyzygy.so: [libJSyzygy.so+0x6513]  probe_dtz+0x403

Version 3.1 (7 January 2022)
  * Hotfix: now the SMP version is working again with tbhits reporting logic

  * Online Syzygy probing implemented. More details: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/issues/9
  * Endgame improvements, more accurate evaluation, it returns often 0 for draw games:
  - knows if the last pawn is captured, then there should be enough mating material, otherwise the end game will be draw in the best case.
  - knows only 2 knights and king are not enough mating material. More details: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/issues/12
  - knows it is better to exchange when the side has more material.

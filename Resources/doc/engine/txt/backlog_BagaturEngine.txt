This is the Bagatur's to-do list (a.k.a the backlog) of features requested by users (or needed to be implemented, because of technical reasons).

1. Improve the parallel algorithm to scale batter on many CPU cores
2. NNUE implementation of the evaluation function. More info: https://www.chessprogramming.org/NNUE, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiently_updatable_neural_network
3. Continuous tuning of the Evaluation function based on the currently best engines

You are more than welcome to contribute.

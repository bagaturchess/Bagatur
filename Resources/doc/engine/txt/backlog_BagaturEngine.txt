This is the Bagatur's to-do list (a.k.a the backlog) of features requested by users (or needed to be implemented, because of technical reasons).

1. NNUE incremental updates - Done but there is no Elo gain.
2. NNUE implementation of the evaluation function - Done, more info: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/NNUE
3. Improve the parallel algorithm to scale batter on many CPU cores - Done but has Java issue when all threads read and write the same memory in a big long arrays. More info: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/blob/master/Search/SMP.scaling.issue.txt

You are more than welcome to contribute.

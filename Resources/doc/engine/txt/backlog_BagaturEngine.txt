This is the Bagatur's to-do list (a.k.a the backlog) of features requested by users (or needed to be implemented, because of technical reasons).

0. NNUE incremental updates.
1. NNUE implementation of the evaluation function - Done without incremental updates. More info: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/NNUE
2. Improve the parallel algorithm to scale batter on many CPU cores - Done but has Java issue when all threads read and write the same memory in a big long arrays. More info: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/blob/master/Search/SMP.scaling.issue.txt
3. Continuous tuning of the Evaluation function based on the currently best engines - not applicable after NNUE implementation.

You are more than welcome to contribute.

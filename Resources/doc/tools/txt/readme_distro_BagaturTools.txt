As a java programmer interested in chess,
you want to programatically be able to:
  1. Parse, process and further analyze chess games in PGN format, which are stored in a file(s)
  2. Create your own opening books for different purposes
  3. Work with Gaviota endgame tablebases via Java API
  4. Capture games of any UCI chess engine via UCI Tracker tool
  4. Experiment with artificial intelligence algorithms over the games set created via capturing or PGN parsing

This software tool is designed to help you in that direction in the context of java programming language.
In order to use it, you just need to include the jar files from the distribution archive to your project
and check the content of readme file in the corresponding sub-project (or jar file).

# Overview

The <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl">LearningImpl</a> project is using <a href="http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/">Neuroph</a> Java framework in order to apply supervised machine learning and tune the Bagatur's evaluation function.
It is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">Multilayer perceptron (MLP)</a> feedforward artificial neural network. It has one layer with many features as the evaluation function becomes too slow to calculate with more layers and cannot compensate the better quality achieved by more layers.  

# How to run

If you want to run one of the supervised learning <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl/src/bagaturchess/deeplearning/run">main classes</a> first you have to generate training chess positions with evaluations using the <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/UCITracker">UCITracker</a> project, which saves these positions into a file.
For that purpose you need a strong chess engine like **Stockfish**, **Komodo**, **Houdini**, **Rybka** or other. Than use the **UCITracker** to run self-play games of this engine and track down the positions played and their evaluations so later a supervised learning can take place.

- <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl/src/bagaturchess/deeplearning/run">Main classes</a>, which iterate the training set. They are for three different networks, which have different features.
- <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl/src/bagaturchess/deeplearning/impl/visitors">Position visitors</a>, which iterate the positions and apply the learning with training sets. They also print the current accuracy.

It leads to weaker version but still playing good chess.

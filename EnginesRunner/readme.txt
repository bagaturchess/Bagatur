This sub-project contains a main method which runs the Bagatur searcher without involving the UCI related components.
It is very appropriate sample reference if you plan to play with the Bagatur's searchers, configurations and/or evaluation functions
or you want to program such artifacts by yourself.

Have a nice usage ... and feel free to contribute.

This sub-project contains the UCI tracker implementation, which is part of Bagatur chess tools.

The learning API is a natural continuation of the UCI Tracker in regards to tune and evolve the evaluation function
by the chess knowledge inside the existing expert games, captured by UCI tracker. 

Extremely useful tool for the fans of Artificial Intelligence!

Have a nice usage ... and feel free to contribute.

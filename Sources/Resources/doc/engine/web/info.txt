1. It is now true, that the MTD(f) works better in 1 thread and SMP version should use parallelism only at the root node - to start many threads, each one runing MTD(f) search of the root position.
2. LazySMP still gives worst ELO strength - If we start all threads with different root moves, than the ELO is less, compared to if all threads start from the last best move got from the  Transposition Table.
3. More details about the MTD(f) algorithm and SMP version, could be found here: https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/Search#readme

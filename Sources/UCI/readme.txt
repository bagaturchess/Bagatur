
This sub-project contains the UCI protocol implementation of Bagatur chess engine.

It represents a reusable implementation of the UCI protocol,
the main interface which decouples the UCI protocol implementation from all other parts
of the Bagatur engine is bagaturchess.uci.api.IUCISearchAdaptor.
The UCI protocol support is not full but anyway allows the engine to play chess with 
chess players or other chess engines via UCI user interfaces (like Arena).

Have a nice usage ... and feel free to contribute.
